- must update client component to work with Person.component just like 
	what Employee.component is doing at this point

- figure out where to put cleanRegex function which is currently
	inside ClientLoader.  this is a function which we will use often.
	
- inside Employee in ManageDialog, it obtains employees from storageService
	inside the actual html.  best to change that to its own local
	employeeList array inside the component, and load it some way inside
	the component.
	
- local storage must check if id is assigned, if not, not create the entry.  In general
	need to implement validation in all of the forms

-	[can't recreate] updating a service inside manager window doesn't work, seems to create
	a new service with jacked up fields, and does not delete
	the old one.

- [DONE] add a notes object with fields, id, date, owner, content.  primarily looking
	to add it to all objects.... especially appointment and clients

- [DONE]finish the employee menu inside ManageDialog (inside AddEmployee)
	- [DONE] export person editor into own class so can use the same object to
	view and edit clients and all that

- [DONE] work on the manage menu: let User.Service return the allowable menus (make
	a stub to return all menus by default, for future expansion)
	probably use an enum for this.
	- [IN PROGRESS] best to integrate this into one component, away from the mainView.html
	as it will get messy because of the many sub-menus

- [DONE] move out menu out of calendar component and into its own component.
use input and output directives only.
- [DONE] map out calendar service on UML with all of its functions
- [DONE] finish create employee dialog, then insert into, then create admin menu, where it hides
the calendar menu and uses main area for that stuff.
