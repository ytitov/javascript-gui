18 July:
	Employee is complete at this point, fixed previous prob.

16 July:
	Employee is getting near completion.  Can't delete notes at this point, need to
	implement that.

15 July:
	Working on using the new Person component instead of the Person edit component
	so not done yet.  Right now updating and adding employees is not working properly

18 June:
	At this point ManageDialog, under Client and Employee, are not using the GuiGTO's 
	so I'm passing the object themselves around.  Not sure if I like that, and the
	whole updating and removing is kind of a cluster.  It relies a lot on loading
	and reloading whole lists.  This is okay maybe for Employees, but not for clients,
	as there may be many of them.  Thus, the loaders, should have a need a 
	load by id functions too.
	
	TODO as of now: really redesign these components (best to just add them to menu
	so we're not destroying the current ones, so there is some sort of functionality)
	or just fork.  in either case they must be redesigned.
